  title="What is a Competitive Analysis?"
>
  <p>
    Also known as a Competitor Analysis, the goal of a Competitive Analysis is
    to formally assess the market and your competition, so you can pull
    inspiration from what is already working for your competitors, and to avoid
    repeating what is not working for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Competitive Analyses typically include comparing the features, navigation,
    content, visuals, taxonomy, and/or usability of your competitors, and are a
    great way to see what consumers might expect from your product, and how your
    product can contribute to the market in a way others have not.

  title="How do you run a Competitive Analysis?"
>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Determine the competitive sites you want to evaluate</h3>
      You should first always talk with your key stakeholders (like your client or
      a product manager) and create a list of the competitive sites or apps they
      think you should evaluate. You should also add to this list by searching for
      your productâ€™s keywords on multiple search engines and seeing what comes up
      most often. You can always return to your stakeholder to validate any found
      competitors if you are uncertain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Create a list of user tasks to complete</h3>
      Write up a set list of tasks for you to complete with each competitor site
      or product. These should be tasks you expect your own users to complete regularly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Document your thoughts and findings</h3>
      Go through each task with each competing product and make note of what works
      well and what does not. Take note of anything that stands out. You should also
      take screenshots at every step for your documentation and presentation. Take
      notes on wait times, difficulties, useful features, and poorly implemented
      features. Note the terminology used by competitors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 4: Find commonalities</h3>
      Find commonalities, both good and bad, between your competitors to determine
      what users will expect from your product.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 5: Consider looking at user reviews</h3>
      If you are not sure if certain commonalities are good or bad, consider finding
      user reviews for these products to determine which commonalities users are
      happy with, and which could be improved upon. When designing your product,
      you should avoid deviating from commonalities that users are accustomed to
      and are happy with. Unfavorable commonalities, however, present opportunities
      or easy wins.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 6: Prepare a presentation</h3>
      Prepare a presentation of your analysis so stakeholders and team members can
      see the issues and opportunities you have uncovered. Include a walkthrough
      of particularly enlightening tasks, and highlight anything that users found
      particularly delightful or problematic. Add a summary, with visuals, of all
      of the things you suggest should be used as inspiration for your product or
      site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 7: Present your analysis</h3>
      Schedule a presentation of your findings. A walkthrough of each task should
      only take a few minutes, but a half-day meeting allows you time to answer questions
      and discuss your findings in depth.

  title="Tips for a great Competitive Analyses"

  <ul>
    <li>
      Working with others? Create a spreadsheet with your competitors as the
      rows, and your tasks as the columns. This can be duplicated for anyone
      else, or you can divide it up by competitors and all work on the same
      spreadsheet.
