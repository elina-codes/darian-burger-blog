<ReviewSectionWhatIs review={currentReview} title="What is a Paper Prototype?">
  <p>
    A Paper Prototype is a paper representation of your interface that you
    construct, out of paper, in order to test your designs during the earliest
    stages of design.
    <br />
    <br />
    The quality of these prototypes can range from a hand-drawn wireframe with just
    enough detail for testing, to a series of screens printed out from beautifully
    detailed designs. Paper Prototypes are used to capture fundamental flaws in functionality
    long before any code has been written, and though it may feel lengthy to build
    as a designer, as you can take 2-3 days to fully create one, they are extremely
    cost-effective as you can be saving a whole team of developers much more time
    than that.
    <br />
    <br />
    True Paper Prototyping is a UX review that is almost outdated, as digital
    programs, like inVision, have replaced the need to physically create the
    prototype out of paper. These programs allow you to create them and make
    adjustments much faster, they can be shared easily, and they often integrate
    with several other tools, making them much more efficient to work with.
    Though outdated, it's important to understand the fundamentals of creating a
    Paper Prototype, which will explain why it became so popular in the first
    place, and why these digital programs are even more popular now.

  title="How do you run a Paper Prototype?"
>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Determine what needs testing</h3>
      First you are going to have to determine the specific area of your product
      you want to test, as building a paper prototype of your entire site or app
      would not be practical.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Create tasks for the user</h3>
      Next you need to create specific tasks for the user to accomplish in your prototype.
      These tasks should represent what users will do in your live product and will
      also allow you to keep the prototype focused to only the areas that are affected
      by this task.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Create and test your interactive elements</h3>
      Create every screen and element that the user may interact with during each
      tasks. Organize them neatly close to your main testing space. You will want
      them within arms reach when the user is going through the tasks. Once you have
      everything created and set up, run through it a few times with a test user,
      like a coworker.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 4: Run the test and take ntoes</h3>
      You will want a partner here who can help you move interactive elements onto
      the screen so you can focus on running the session and take notes. It's always
      a great idea to film the session from an angle that will let you see what the
      user is doing so you don't have to take such detailed notes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 5: Iterate based on feedback.</h3>
      Iterate your paper prototype based on the feedback you get, and test the new
      version with more users.
    </li>
  </ol>

  title="Tips for a great Paper Prototyping"
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If a user somehow strays from the flow and navigates to an entire area
      that you do not have prepped, make note of what happened and simply
      explain that they have strayed from the flow, or place a 404 page in front
      of them.
    </li>
    <li>
      While running a test and you come across a small element that is missing
      from your prototype (like an error message or notification), you can
      quickly draw it and add it in.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the participant uncovers a fundamental flaw in the functionality of
      your design or your prototype, try to fix it in between test sessions if
      you can. It may only require an extra element or two and may allow you to
      get better feedback from the rest of the participants.
    </li>
  </ul>
